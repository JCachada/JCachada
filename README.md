ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is JoÃ£o Cachada. Nice to meet you!

I was born in Portugal in 1995 and I currently work remotely from there as Senior Backend Engineer. I also write fiction and develop games in my free time.

Welcome to my Github - you can find my current coding projects here. If you're interested in my other projects that might not involve writing code, check out my website
at <https://jcachada.dev>.

Thanks for checking my work out. I hope you found what you were looking for!
